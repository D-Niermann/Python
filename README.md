# Python 
Just some random Python Projects I did in my time as a student. Feel free to open the files and read them. Most of them should also just run on any Windows PC or Mac. (Working Directory may need to be set)

## GUI Applications with TKInter
Applications that run with TKinter. I made these to learn more complex programs and because I really wanted to use these apps for myself or give them to friends.
### Timer

A simple timer which counts input minutes and seconds down to zero. I couldn't find such a simple solution online. 

### Interactive Plot
Simple tool for plotting a function f(x) over x given 3 parameters which can be changed interactivley

### Text Highlight
Programm that searches for duplicate sentence beginnings and marks them. For controlling your own written texts for redundancy

### UISearchProgramm
Search Tool that works like Spotlight for Mac, exept its slower and way more stupid.
Teached myself how to use GUI applications and multiple threads.

## Non GUI Applications
Applications that are a bit more fleshed out but dont use TKInter.
### Conways Game of Life
Implementation of the game.

### SpAm
Image manipulation tool with multiple filters and features.



## Other scripts
Simple scripts
### FEM
Simple FEM program I did in a course in university.

### Feigenbaum
Code for my physics class concerning the feigenbaum constant.

### Island Terrain Generator
Generate height maps and plant spots randomly, also generating gravity based rivers.

### Logger 
Logger class that helps to print out structured logs.

### NeuralNetwork
Simple neural network, one of my first NN projects, only using numpy, requires MNIST dataset in readable form. Teached me the basics of NNs

### PID Temp
The goal was to programm a simple PID to controll temperature in another real application project.
I simulated an very delayed heating, like it was observed in the real application and tried to mimic a PID
to better control the (binary on/off) heating. The goal is to heat a chamber from 22 to 24 degree celcius.
Without PID (set PARAM1 to 1) the heating overshoots, with good value of PARAM1 = 10 the PID does not overshoot and keeps T more constant around 4.

### Pathfinding
My try at a pathfinding algorithm. It plots the steps live.

### Predator Prey
Very simple solver for a coupled differential equation. (predetor prey model).

### heat_diff
solving the heat equation
